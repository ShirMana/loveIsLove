          Love is Love
        </h1>
        <p class="lead text-center indie">
          Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental
          states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest
          interpersonal affection and to the simplest pleasure. An example of
          this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the
          love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly,
          love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional
          attachment.

        <p class="lead indie">
            Biological models of sex tend to view love as a mammalian drive,
            much like hunger or thirst. Helen Fisher, an anthropologist and
            human behavior researcher, divides the experience of love into three
            partly overlapping stages: lust, attraction, and attachment.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Lust is the feeling of sexual desire; romantic attraction determines
            what partners mates find attractive and pursue, conserving time and
            energy by choosing; and attachment involves sharing a home, parental
            duties, mutual defense, and in humans involves feelings of safety
            and security. Three distinct neural circuitries, including
            neurotransmitters, and three behavioral patterns, are associated
            with these three romantic styles.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes mating,
            and involves the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone
            and estrogen. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or
            months. Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire
            for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as
            commitment to an individual mate forms. Recent studies in
            neuroscience have indicated that as people fall in love, the brain
            consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the
            neurotransmitter hormones, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin,
            the same compounds released by amphetamine, stimulating the brain's
            pleasure center and leading to side effects such as increased heart
            rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of
            excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts
            from one and a half to three years.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Since the lust and attraction stages are both considered temporary,
            a third stage is needed to account for long-term relationships.
            Attachment is the bonding that promotes relationships lasting for
            many years and even decades. Attachment is generally based on
            commitments such as marriage and children, or mutual friendship
            based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher
            levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin to a greater degree
            than short-term relationships have. Enzo Emanuele and coworkers
            reported the protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor (NGF)
            has high levels when people first fall in love, but these return to
            previous levels after one year.

            </span>
        <p class="lead indie">
            Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon.
            Psychologist Robert Sternberg formulated a triangular theory of love
            and argued that love has three different components: intimacy,
            commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people
            share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and
            is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Commitment, on the other hand, is the expectation that the
            relationship is permanent. The last form of love is sexual
            attraction and passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as
            well as romantic love. All forms of love are viewed as varying
            combinations of these three components. Non-love does not include
            any of these components. Liking only includes intimacy. Infatuated
            love only includes passion. Empty love only includes commitment.
            Romantic love includes both intimacy and passion. Companionate love
            includes intimacy and commitment. Fatuous love includes passion and
            commitment. Lastly, consummate love includes all three components.
            American psychologist Zick Rubin sought to define love by
            psychometrics in the 1970s. His work states that three factors
            constitute love: attachment, caring, and intimacy.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Following developments in electrical theories such as Coulomb's law,
            which showed that positive and negative charges attract, analogs in
            human life were developed, such as "opposites attract". Over the
            last century, research on the nature of human mating has generally
            found this not to be true when it comes to character and
            personality—people tend to like people similar to themselves.
            However, in a few unusual and specific domains, such as immune
            systems, it seems that humans prefer others who are unlike
            themselves (e.g., with an orthogonal immune system), since this will
            lead to a baby that has the best of both worlds. In recent years,
            various human bonding theories have been developed, described in
            terms of attachments, ties, bonds, and affinities. Some Western
            authorities disaggregate into two main components, the altruistic
            and the narcissistic. This view is represented in the works of Scott
            Peck, whose work in the field of applied psychology explored the
            definitions of love and evil. Peck maintains that love is a
            combination of the "concern for the spiritual growth of another,"
            and simple narcissism. In combination, love is an activity, not
            simply a feeling.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Psychologist Erich Fromm maintained in his book The Art of Loving
            that love is not merely a feeling but is also actions, and that in
            fact, the "feeling" of love is superficial in comparison to one's
            commitment to love via a series of loving actions over time. In this
            sense, Fromm held that love is ultimately not a feeling at all, but
            rather is a commitment to, and adherence to, loving actions towards
            another, oneself, or many others, over a sustained duration.[19]
            Fromm also described love as a conscious choice that in its early
            stages might originate as an involuntary feeling, but which then
            later no longer depends on those feelings, but rather depends only
            on conscious commitment.

        <p class="lead indie">
            Evolutionary psychology has attempted to provide various reasons for
            love as a survival tool. Humans are dependent on parental help for a
            large portion of their lifespans compared to other mammals.
          </p>
          <p class="lead indie">
            Love has therefore been seen as a mechanism to promote parental
            support of children for this extended time period. Furthermore,
            researchers as early as Charles Darwin himself identified unique
            features of human love compared to other mammals and credit love as
            a major factor for creating social support systems that enabled the
            development and expansion of the human species. Another factor may
            be that sexually transmitted diseases can cause, among other
            effects, permanently reduced fertility, injury to the fetus, and
            increase complications during childbirth. This would favor
            monogamous relationships over polygamy.
